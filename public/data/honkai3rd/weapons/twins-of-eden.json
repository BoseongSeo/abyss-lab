While Grav Bomb exists, [Grav Lock] is inflicted on the target if their shield breaks, disabling them and freezing shield regen for 3s. Grav Bomb explodes in 3s dealing 500% ATK of AOE Physical DMG. The generation of Grav Lock and explosion of Grav Bomb both grant 12.0% bonus team Physical DMG for 9s (can be refreshed but not stacked). Grav Bomb instantly explodes if hitting enemies with no or broken shield."
