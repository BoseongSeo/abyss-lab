# It Will Be Written

Effect: Grants 1 extra level when choosing a Signet of Deliverance. A special skill that causes the enemy with the highest HP to become icebound and receive massive DMG after 10 hits is available once Charge reaches 600. This insta-kills non-bosses while causing bosses massive HP loss. (DMG increases with Deep Sequence difficulty and the number of floors reached.)
Charging: Gain 200 Charge for every Ultimate use. CD: 10s.
