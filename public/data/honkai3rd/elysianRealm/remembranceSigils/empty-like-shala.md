Effect: Grants 1 extra level when choosing a Signet of Bodhi. A special skill that increases Valkyrie ATK and Move Speed by 20% for 6s is available once Charge reaches 600. It then causes massive HP loss for all enemies based on the DMG Valkyrie dealt during this time and knock them down. (DMG increases with Deep Sequence difficulty and the number of floors reached.)
Charging: Gain 60 Charge for every 150 combo hits.
