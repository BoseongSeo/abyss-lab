# Out of Reach

Effect: Grants 1 extra level when choosing a Signet of Daybreak. A special skill that launches a vortex that pulls in enemies is available once Charge reaches 600. The vortex causes multiple HP loss per second and stacks Rend every 0.5s for 10s. (DMG increases with Deep Sequence difficulty and the number of floors reached.)
Charging: Gain 20 Charge if an enemy is nearby and 10 additional Charge if there are more than 2 enemies nearby.
