# Boundless Feeling

Effect: Grants 1 extra level when choosing a Signet of Discipline. A special skill that pulls in enemies and calls waves of Rain of Light to pour down, each causing HP loss for 10s, is available once Charge reaches 600. (DMG increases with Deep Sequence difficulty and the number of floors reached.) Rain of Light's DMG increases by 30% with each use, caps at 120%, and resets after exiting stage.
Charging: Gain 30 Charge per second in combat.
