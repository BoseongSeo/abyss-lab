Effect: Grants 1 extra level when choosing a Signet of Setsuna. Chrono Slash becomes available once Charge reaches 600, which causes massive HP loss for all enemies, then consecutive HP loss and a 4s Time Lock. (DMG increases with Deep Sequence difficulty and the number of floors reached.)
Charging: Gain 120 Charge for every Ultimate Evasion Skill triggered. CD: 6s.
